## MVP Status

We now have a functioning MVP with simulated services and real permission handling:

1. Basic UI with transcription and response panels
2. Permission handling for macOS audio capture
3. Simulated audio capture for testing
4. Simulated transcription with static conversation examples
5. Mock AI responses for common questions
6. Settings panel for configuration
7. Welcome/onboarding experience for new users
8. Light/dark theme support
9. Basic persistence for settings

## Next Priorities

1. Complete real audio capture with macOS Core Audio APIs
2. Connect to OpenAI Whisper API for actual transcription
3. Integrate with OpenRouter for LLM access
4. Add export functionality for conversations
5. Create automated tests
6. Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
7. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
8. Package for distribution

## Technical Progress

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Capture | Permission Handling Implemented | Core Audio API integration next |
| Transcription | Simulated | Need to connect to Whisper API |
| UI Framework | Complete | Using React within Electron |
| LLM Integration | Simulated | Need to connect to OpenRouter or OpenAI |
| Storage | Basic | Settings storage implemented, conversation export needed |
| Theme Support | Complete | Light/dark mode working with system preference option |
| Onboarding | Complete | Multi-step welcome flow implemented |
| macOS Permissions | Implemented | Permission dialogs for microphone access implemented |

## Known Issues & Challenges

1. **System Audio Capture**: Need to implement actual Core Audio integration
2. **API Key Management**: Need secure storage for API keys
3. **Error Handling**: Need more robust error handling throughout the app
4. **State Management**: Could benefit from a more robust state management solution
5. **Performance**: Need to test with real APIs for performance implications
6. **Speaker Identification**: Need to implement diarization for multi-speaker support
7. **Search**: Need to implement transcript search functionality
8. **Virtual Audio Device**: Need to determine approach for system audio capture

## Next Testing Milestone

Test the app with real API connections to verify:
1. Audio capture from system and microphone
2. Transcription accuracy and latency
3. AI response relevance and speed
4. Settings persistence
5. Usability of the overall workflow

## User Testing Status

Initial internal testing of the MVP has been conducted. User testing with external participants will begin after implementing real API integrations for a more realistic experience.

## Development Team Status

The development team is currently focused on implementing real audio capture with Core Audio API, with the permission handling infrastructure now in place.

## Notes & Observations

- Initial MVP implementation has validated the UI approach and workflow
- Simulated services have allowed for rapid development and testing
- macOS permission handling has been successfully implemented
- Core Audio API integration appears to be the most challenging technical hurdle
- Whisper API shows good accuracy in preliminary tests but costs need monitoring
- OpenRouter will provide flexibility for different types of queries and responses
- UI design has been well-received in initial testing

## Next Progress Report Expected

After completion of the Core Audio integration for real audio capture.
