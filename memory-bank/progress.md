## MVP Status

We now have a functional MVP that includes:

1. Basic UI with transcription and response panels
2. Simulated audio capture for testing
3. Simulated transcription with static examples
4. Mock AI responses for common questions
5. Settings panel for configuration
6. Welcome/onboarding experience for new users
7. Light/dark theme support
8. Basic persistence for settings

## Next Priorities

1. Implement real audio capture with macOS Core Audio APIs
2. Connect to OpenAI Whisper API for actual transcription
3. Integrate with OpenRouter for LLM access
4. Add export functionality for conversations
5. Create automated tests
6. Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
7. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Progress

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Audio Capture | Simulated | Need to implement Core Audio API integration |
| Transcription | Simulated | Need to connect to Whisper API |
| UI Framework | Complete | Using React within Electron |
| LLM Integration | Simulated | Need to connect to OpenRouter or OpenAI |
| Storage | Basic | Settings storage implemented, conversation export needed |

## Known Issues & Challenges

1. **System Audio Capture**: Need to implement actual Core Audio integration
2. **API Key Management**: Need secure storage for API keys
3. **Error Handling**: Need more robust error handling throughout the app
4. **State Management**: Could benefit from a more robust state management solution

## Next Testing Milestone

Test the app with real API connections to verify:
1. Audio capture from system and microphone
2. Transcription accuracy and latency
3. AI response relevance and speed
4. Settings persistence
5. Usability of the overall workflow

## Milestone Tracking

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Completion |
|-----------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Requirements & Planning | TBD | In Progress | 60% |
| Technical Research | TBD | In Progress | 30% |
| Proof of Concept | TBD | Not Started | 0% |
| Alpha Version | TBD | Not Started | 0% |
| Beta Version | TBD | Not Started | 0% |
| 1.0 Release | TBD | Not Started | 0% |

## User Testing Status

No user testing has been conducted yet. Initial user testing will begin after the development of a minimum viable prototype with basic audio capture and transcription functionality.

## Development Team Status

The project is currently in the planning phase. Development team setup and assignment will occur after requirements are finalized and technical approach is validated.

## Notes & Observations

- Initial research suggests Core Audio API is the most promising approach for system audio capture
- Whisper API shows good accuracy but may need supplementation with local processing for latency-sensitive operations
- OpenRouter integration should provide flexibility for different types of queries and responses
- UI design will be critical for user adoption - must be unobtrusive yet highly accessible

## Next Progress Report Expected

After completion of the PRD and initial technical proof-of-concept work.
