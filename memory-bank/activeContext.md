# Active Context - AI Call Assistant

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the AI Call Assistant, with the following key components:

1. **Electron Application Structure**
   - Main process setup with IPC communication
   - Renderer process with React components
   - Service-based architecture

2. **Simulated Core Services**
   - Audio capture service (simulated for development)
   - Transcription service (simulated responses)
   - LLM response generation (mock responses for common queries)
   - Database service for settings and conversation storage

3. **UI Components**
   - Main application shell with responsive layout
   - TranscriptionPanel for displaying conversation text
   - ResponsePanel for showing AI responses
   - ControlPanel for managing audio capture
   - SettingsPanel for configuring application preferences
   - WelcomeScreen for first-time user onboarding

## Immediate Focus

Our immediate focus is to transition from the simulated services to real implementations:

1. **Audio Capture Integration**
   - Implement Core Audio API integration for system audio
   - Add microphone input with appropriate permissions
   - Develop audio buffering and processing

2. **Transcription API Integration**
   - Connect to OpenAI Whisper API
   - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
   - Add speaker identification capabilities

3. **LLM Service Integration**
   - Connect to OpenRouter for AI response generation
   - Implement robust context management
   - Add better prompt engineering

## Current Decisions

1. **API Integration Strategy**
   - Using OpenAI Whisper API for transcription
   - Using OpenRouter for LLM access to provide flexibility

2. **State Management**
   - Currently using React Context API and local state
   - May need to migrate to a more robust solution (Redux, Zustand) as complexity grows

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Implementing Jest for unit tests
   - Using Playwright for E2E testing

## Outstanding Questions

1. How will we handle API rate limiting and fallback strategies?
2. What is the best approach for secure API key storage?
3. Should we implement a local transcription fallback option?
4. What level of conversation context should we maintain for LLM queries?
5. How will we implement data export functionality?

## Recent Changes

1. Implemented SettingsPanel component with all configuration options
2. Created WelcomeScreen with multi-step onboarding process
3. Integrated settings persistence
4. Added API key configuration UI
5. Implemented light/dark theme support

## Next Steps

1. Replace simulated audio capture with actual Core Audio integration
2. Connect to OpenAI Whisper API for real-time transcription
3. Implement OpenRouter integration for LLM responses
4. Add conversation export functionality
5. Develop more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
6. Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
7. Implement automated testing

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Need to optimize audio processing for minimal latency
   - Consider chunking transcription requests for better performance
   - Implement proper memory management for long conversations

2. **Security**
   - Need secure storage for API keys
   - Consider encryption for stored conversations
   - Implement proper permission handling

3. **Usability**
   - Need to refine the UX for real-time transcription feedback
   - Improve error messaging for API failures
   - Add visual indicators for audio capture quality
