# Project Brief: AI Call Assistant (AICA)

## Project Overview
AI Call Assistant (AICA) is a macOS application that provides real-time AI assistance during calls and meetings by capturing audio, transcribing conversations, and generating helpful information based on the conversation content.

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented an MVP with simulated services. The next phase will focus on replacing these simulations with real API integrations for audio capture, transcription, and LLM responses.

## Core Problem Statement
During calls and meetings, participants often need to quickly retrieve information, get answers to questions, or gather additional context without disrupting the flow of conversation. Current solutions require manual note-taking and separate searches, creating a disjointed experience that diverts attention away from the conversation.

## Project Goals
1. Create a seamless AI assistant that augments conversations in real-time
2. Provide accurate, contextually relevant information during calls
3. Reduce cognitive load during conversations
4. Minimize manual research needs during meetings
5. Create an unobtrusive, helpful companion for professional and personal calls

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Audio Capture**
   - Capture desktop audio output
   - Capture speaker/microphone input
   - Process multiple audio streams simultaneously

2. **Transcription Engine**
   - Provide real-time transcription of conversations
   - Distinguish between different speakers
   - Maintain a searchable transcript history

3. **AI Response Generation**
   - Recognize questions within conversation
   - Generate contextually relevant answers
   - Provide additional related information
   - Use OpenRouter for LLM integration

4. **User Interface**
   - Display live transcription
   - Present AI-generated responses clearly
   - Allow quick copying of information
   - Provide an unobtrusive experience

### Future Capabilities (Phase 2)
1. **Screen Capture**
   - Process visual information from screen
   - Use screen context to enhance responses

2. **Web Search Integration**
   - Perform real-time web searches based on conversation
   - Integrate external information into responses

3. **File Processing**
   - Allow file uploads for additional context
   - Reference documents during conversation

### Technical Requirements
1. Compatible with macOS
2. Efficient audio processing with minimal latency
3. Secure handling of conversation data
4. Offline capabilities for essential functions
5. OpenRouter integration for LLM services

### Performance Requirements
1. Real-time transcription with <1 second delay
2. AI response generation within 3 seconds
3. Minimal CPU/memory footprint
4. Battery-efficient operation

## Implementation Progress

### Completed (MVP)
1. Full application structure with Electron and React
2. UI components including transcription display, response panel, and settings
3. Simulated audio capture for development
4. Mock transcription service with example conversations
5. Simulated LLM responses for common queries
6. Settings panel with all configuration options
7. Welcome screen with multi-step onboarding
8. Light/dark theme support

### Next Steps
1. Implement real audio capture using macOS Core Audio API
2. Connect to OpenAI Whisper API for transcription
3. Integrate with OpenRouter for LLM responses
4. Add data export functionality
5. Implement automated testing
6. Package for distribution

## Target Users
1. Professionals in meetings and calls
2. Students in virtual classrooms
3. Users who frequently participate in interviews
4. Anyone seeking enhanced information retrieval during conversations

## Success Metrics
1. Transcription accuracy rate >95%
2. AI response relevance rating >80%
3. User satisfaction score >4.5/5
4. Average time saved per meeting >10 minutes

## Project Constraints
1. Initial release for macOS only
2. Dependent on OpenRouter API availability
3. Audio quality limitations based on input sources
4. Privacy considerations for conversation data
