## 1. Executive Summary

AI Call Assistant (AICA) is a macOS application designed to enhance conversations and meetings by providing real-time AI assistance. AICA captures audio from both system output and microphone input, transcribes the conversation, and uses AI to generate contextually relevant information and answers to questions that arise during the conversation.

The application addresses the challenge of information access during live conversations, where interrupting the flow to look up information can disrupt the natural dialogue. By providing unobtrusive, real-time assistance, AICA helps users stay engaged in the conversation while having immediate access to helpful information.

Key features include real-time transcription, question detection, AI-powered responses, and a non-disruptive user interface. Future capabilities will include screen capture for visual context, web search integration, and file upload processing.

## 2. Product Vision

### Vision Statement
To transform how people participate in conversations by providing seamless, intelligent assistance that enhances communication without disruption.

### Mission
Empower users with real-time information access during calls and meetings, reducing cognitive load and enabling more meaningful, informed conversations.

### Core Value Proposition
AI Call Assistant bridges the gap between live conversation and information retrieval, providing relevant context and answers precisely when needed without disrupting the natural flow of dialogue.

### Strategic Alignment
This product addresses the growing need for intelligent assistance in a world where remote and hybrid meetings have become standard. It aligns with the trend toward AI augmentation of human activities and the need for tools that enhance productivity without adding complexity.
